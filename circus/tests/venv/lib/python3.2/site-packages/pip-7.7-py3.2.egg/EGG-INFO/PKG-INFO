        ===
        
        `pip` is a tool for installing and managing Python packages, such as
        those found in the `Python Package Index`_. It's a replacement for
        easy_install_.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        Next release (1.2) schedule
        ---------------------------
        
        Beta and final releases planned for the second half of 2012.
        
        1.1 (2012-02-16)
        ----------------
        
        * Fixed issue #326 - don't crash when a package's setup.py emits UTF-8 and
          then fails. Thanks Marc Abramowitz.
        
        * Added ``--target`` option for installing directly to arbitrary directory.
          Thanks Stavros Korokithakis.
        
        * Added support for authentication with Subversion repositories. Thanks
          Qiangning Hong.
        
        * Fixed issue #315 - ``--download`` now downloads dependencies as well.
          Thanks Qiangning Hong.
        
        * Errors from subprocesses will display the current working directory.
          Thanks Antti Kaihola.
        
        * Fixed issue #369 - compatibility with Subversion 1.7. Thanks Qiangning
          Hong. Note that setuptools remains incompatible with Subversion 1.7; to
          get the benefits of pip's support you must use Distribute rather than
          setuptools.
        
        * Fixed issue #57 - ignore py2app-generated OS X mpkg zip files in finder.
          Thanks Rene Dudfield.
        
        * Fixed issue #182 - log to ~/Library/Logs/ by default on OS X framework
          installs. Thanks Dan Callahan for report and patch.
        
        * Fixed issue #310 - understand version tags without minor version ("py3")
          in sdist filenames. Thanks Stuart Andrews for report and Olivier Girardot for
          patch.
        
        * Fixed issue #7 - Pip now supports optionally installing setuptools
          "extras" dependencies; e.g. "pip install Paste[openid]". Thanks Matt Maker
          and Olivier Girardot.
        
        * Fixed issue #391 - freeze no longer borks on requirements files with
          --index-url or --find-links. Thanks Herbert Pfennig.
        
        * Fixed issue #288 - handle symlinks properly. Thanks lebedov for the patch.
        
        * Fixed issue #49 - pip install -U no longer reinstalls the same versions of
          packages. Thanks iguananaut for the pull request.
        
        * Removed ``-E`` option and ``PIP_RESPECT_VIRTUALENV``; both use a
          restart-in-venv mechanism that's broken, and neither one is useful since
          every virtualenv now has pip inside it.
        
        * Fixed issue #366 - pip throws IndexError when it calls `scraped_rel_links`
        
        * Fixed issue #22 - pip search should set and return a userful shell status code
        
        * Fixed issue #351 and #365 - added global ``--exists-action`` command line
          option to easier script file exists conflicts, e.g. from editable
          requirements from VCS that have a changed repo URL.
        
        
        1.0.2 (2011-07-16)
        ------------------
        
        * Fixed docs issues.
        * Fixed issue #295 - Reinstall a package when using the ``install -I`` option
        * Fixed issue #283 - Finds a Git tag pointing to same commit as origin/master
        * Fixed issue #279 - Use absolute path for path to docs in setup.py
        * Fixed issue #314 - Correctly handle exceptions on Python3.
        * Fixed issue #320 - Correctly parse ``--editable`` lines in requirements files
        
        1.0.1 (2011-04-30)
        ------------------
        
        * Start to use git-flow.
        * Fixed issue #274 - `find_command` should not raise AttributeError
        * Fixed issue #273 - respect Content-Disposition header. Thanks Bradley Ayers.
        * Fixed issue #233 - pathext handling on Windows.
        * Fixed issue #252 - svn+svn protocol.
        * Fixed issue #44 - multiple CLI searches.
        * Fixed issue #266 - current working directory when running setup.py clean.
        
        1.0 (2011-04-04)
        ----------------
        
        * Added Python 3 support! Huge thanks to Vinay Sajip, Vitaly Babiy, Kelsey
          Hightower, and Alex Gronholm, among others.
        
        * Download progress only shown on a real TTY. Thanks Alex Morega.
        
        * Fixed finding of VCS binaries to not be fooled by same-named directories.
          Thanks Alex Morega.
        
        * Fixed uninstall of packages from system Python for users of Debian/Ubuntu
          python-setuptools package (workaround until fixed in Debian and Ubuntu).
        
        * Added `get-pip.py <https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py>`_
          installer. Simply download and execute it, using the Python interpreter of
          your choice::
        
            $ curl -O https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py
            $ python get-pip.py
        
          This may have to be run as root.
        
          .. note::
        
              Make sure you have `distribute <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/distribute>`_
              installed before using the installer!

        0.8
        ---
        
        * Track which ``build/`` directories pip creates, never remove directories
          it doesn't create.  From Hugo Lopes Tavares.
        
        * Pip now accepts file:// index URLs. Thanks Dave Abrahams.
        
        * Various cleanup to make test-running more consistent and less fragile.
          Thanks Dave Abrahams.
        
        * Real Windows support (with passing tests). Thanks Dave Abrahams.
        
        * ``pip-2.7`` etc. scripts are created (Python-version specific scripts)
        
        * ``contrib/build-standalone`` script creates a runnable ``.zip`` form of
          pip, from Jannis Leidel
        
        * Editable git repos are updated when reinstalled
        
        * Fix problem with ``--editable`` when multiple ``.egg-info/`` directories
          are found.
        
        * A number of VCS-related fixes for ``pip freeze``, from Hugo Lopes Tavares.
        
        * Significant test framework changes, from Hugo Lopes Tavares.
        
        0.7.2
        -----
        
        * Set zip_safe=False to avoid problems some people are encountering where
          pip is installed as a zip file.
        
        0.7.1
        -----
        
        * Fixed opening of logfile with no directory name. Thanks Alexandre Conrad.
        
        * Temporary files are consistently cleaned up, especially after
          installing bundles, also from Alex Conrad.
        
        * Tests now require at least ScriptTest 1.0.3.
        
        0.7
        ---
        
        * Fixed uninstallation on Windows
        * Added ``pip search`` command.
        * Tab-complete names of installed distributions for ``pip uninstall``.
        * Support tab-completion when there is a global-option before the
          subcommand.
        * Install header files in standard (scheme-default) location when installing
          outside a virtualenv. Install them to a slightly more consistent
          non-standard location inside a virtualenv (since the standard location is
          a non-writable symlink to the global location).
        * pip now logs to a central location by default (instead of creating
          ``pip-log.txt`` all over the place) and constantly overwrites the
          file in question. On Unix and Mac OS X this is ``'$HOME/.pip/pip.log'``
          and on Windows it's ``'%HOME%\\pip\\pip.log'``. You are still able to
          override this location with the ``$PIP_LOG_FILE`` environment variable.
          For a complete (appended) logfile use the separate ``'--log'`` command line
          option.
        * Fixed an issue with Git that left an editable packge as a checkout of a
          remote branch, even if the default behaviour would have been fine, too.
        * Fixed installing from a Git tag with older versions of Git.
        * Expand "~" in logfile and download cache paths.
        * Speed up installing from Mercurial repositories by cloning without
          updating the working copy multiple times.
        * Fixed installing directly from directories (e.g.
          ``pip install path/to/dir/``).
        * Fixed installing editable packages with ``svn+ssh`` URLs.
        * Don't print unwanted debug information when running the freeze command.
        * Create log file directory automatically. Thanks Alexandre Conrad.
        * Make test suite easier to run successfully. Thanks Dave Abrahams.
        * Fixed "pip install ." and "pip install .."; better error for directory
          without setup.py. Thanks Alexandre Conrad.
        * Support Debian/Ubuntu "dist-packages" in zip command. Thanks duckx.
        * Fix relative --src folder. Thanks Simon Cross.
        * Handle missing VCS with an error message. Thanks Alexandre Conrad.
        * Added --no-download option to install; pairs with --no-install to separate
          download and installation into two steps. Thanks Simon Cross.
        * Fix uninstalling from requirements file containing -f, -i, or
          --extra-index-url.
        * Leftover build directories are now removed. Thanks Alexandre Conrad.
        
        0.6.3
        -----
        
        * Fixed import error on Windows with regard to the backwards compatibility
          package
        
        0.6.2
        -----
        
        * Fixed uninstall when /tmp is on a different filesystem.
        
        * Fixed uninstallation of distributions with namespace packages.
        
        0.6.1
        -----
        
        * Added support for the ``https`` and ``http-static`` schemes to the
          Mercurial and ``ftp`` scheme to the Bazaar backend.
        
        * Fixed uninstallation of scripts installed with easy_install.
        
        * Fixed an issue in the package finder that could result in an
          infinite loop while looking for links.
        
        * Fixed issue with ``pip bundle`` and local files (which weren't being
          copied into the bundle), from Whit Morriss.
        
        0.6
        ---
        
        * Add ``pip uninstall`` and uninstall-before upgrade (from Carl
          Meyer).
        
        * Extended configurability with config files and environment variables.
        
        * Allow packages to be upgraded, e.g., ``pip install Package==0.1``
          then ``pip install Package==0.2``.
        
        * Allow installing/upgrading to Package==dev (fix "Source version does not
          match target version" errors).
        
        * Added command and option completion for bash and zsh.
        
        * Extended integration with virtualenv by providing an option to
          automatically use an active virtualenv and an option to warn if no active
          virtualenv is found.
        
        * Fixed a bug with pip install --download and editable packages, where
          directories were being set with 0000 permissions, now defaults to 755.
        
        * Fixed uninstallation of easy_installed console_scripts.
        
        * Fixed uninstallation on Mac OS X Framework layout installs
        
        * Fixed bug preventing uninstall of editables with source outside venv.
        
        * Creates download cache directory if not existing.
        
        0.5.1
        -----
        
        * Fixed a couple little bugs, with git and with extensions.
        
        0.5
        ---
        
        * Added ability to override the default log file name (``pip-log.txt``)
          with the environmental variable ``$PIP_LOG_FILE``.
        
        * Made the freeze command print installed packages to stdout instead of
          writing them to a file. Use simple redirection (e.g.
          ``pip freeze > stable-req.txt``) to get a file with requirements.
        
        * Fixed problem with freezing editable packages from a Git repository.
        
        * Added support for base URLs using ``<base href='...'>`` when parsing
          HTML pages.
        
        * Fixed installing of non-editable packages from version control systems.
        
        * Fixed issue with Bazaar's bzr+ssh scheme.
        
        * Added --download-dir option to the install command to retrieve package
          archives. If given an editable package it will create an archive of it.
        
        * Added ability to pass local file and directory paths to ``--find-links``,
          e.g. ``--find-links=file:///path/to/my/private/archive``
        
        * Reduced the amount of console log messages when fetching a page to find a
          distribution was problematic. The full messages can be found in pip-log.txt.
        
        * Added ``--no-deps`` option to install ignore package dependencies
        
        * Added ``--no-index`` option to ignore the package index (PyPI) temporarily
        
        * Fixed installing editable packages from Git branches.
        
        * Fixes freezing of editable packages from Mercurial repositories.
        
        * Fixed handling read-only attributes of build files, e.g. of Subversion and
          Bazaar on Windows.
        
        * When downloading a file from a redirect, use the redirected
          location's extension to guess the compression (happens specifically
          when redirecting to a bitbucket.org tip.gz file).
        
        * Editable freeze URLs now always use revision hash/id rather than tip or
          branch names which could move.
        
        * Fixed comparison of repo URLs so incidental differences such as
          presence/absence of final slashes or quoted/unquoted special
          characters don't trigger "ignore/switch/wipe/backup" choice.
        
        * Fixed handling of attempt to checkout editable install to a
          non-empty, non-repo directory.
        
        0.4
        ---
        
        * Make ``-e`` work better with local hg repositories
        
        * Construct PyPI URLs the exact way easy_install constructs URLs (you
          might notice this if you use a custom index that is
          slash-sensitive).
        
        * Improvements on Windows (from `Ionel Maries Cristian
          <http://ionelmc.wordpress.com/>`_).
        
        * Fixed problem with not being able to install private git repositories.
        
        * Make ``pip zip`` zip all its arguments, not just the first.
        
        * Fix some filename issues on Windows.
        
        * Allow the ``-i`` and ``--extra-index-url`` options in requirements
          files.
        
        * Fix the way bundle components are unpacked and moved around, to make
          bundles work.
        
        * Adds ``-s`` option to allow the access to the global site-packages if a
          virtualenv is to be created.
        
        * Fixed support for Subversion 1.6.

        * Improved virtualenv restart and various path/cleanup problems on win32.
        
        * Fixed a regression with installing from svn repositories (when not
          using ``-e``).
        
        * Fixes when installing editable packages that put their source in a
          subdirectory (like ``src/``).
        
        * Improve ``pip -h``
        
        0.3
        ---
        
        * Added support for editable packages created from Git, Mercurial and Bazaar
          repositories and ability to freeze them. Refactored support for version
          control systems.
        
        * Do not use ``sys.exit()`` from inside the code, instead use a
          return.  This will make it easier to invoke programmatically.
        
        * Put the install record in ``Package.egg-info/installed-files.txt``
          (previously they went in
          ``site-packages/install-record-Package.txt``).
        
        * Fix a problem with ``pip freeze`` not including ``-e svn+`` when an
          svn structure is peculiar.
        
        * Allow ``pip -E`` to work with a virtualenv that uses a different
          version of Python than the parent environment.
        
        * Fixed Win32 virtualenv (``-E``) option.
        
        * Search the links passed in with ``-f`` for packages.
        
        * Detect zip files, even when the file doesn't have a ``.zip``
          extension and it is served with the wrong Content-Type.
        
        * Installing editable from existing source now works, like ``pip
          install -e some/path/`` will install the package in ``some/path/``.
          Most importantly, anything that package requires will also be
          installed by pip.
        
        * Add a ``--path`` option to ``pip un/zip``, so you can avoid zipping
          files that are outside of where you expect.
        
        * Add ``--simulate`` option to ``pip zip``.
        
        0.2.1
        -----
        
        * Fixed small problem that prevented using ``pip.py`` without actually
          installing pip.
        
        * Fixed ``--upgrade``, which would download and appear to install
          upgraded packages, but actually just reinstall the existing package.
        
        * Fixed Windows problem with putting the install record in the right
          place, and generating the ``pip`` script with Setuptools.
        
        * Download links that include embedded spaces or other unsafe
          characters (those characters get %-encoded).
        
        * Fixed use of URLs in requirement files, and problems with some blank
          lines.
        
        * Turn some tar file errors into warnings.
        
        0.2
        ---
        
        * Renamed to ``pip``, and to install you now do ``pip install
          PACKAGE``
        
        * Added command ``pip zip PACKAGE`` and ``pip unzip PACKAGE``.  This
          is particularly intended for Google App Engine to manage libraries
          to stay under the 1000-file limit.
        
        * Some fixes to bundles, especially editable packages and when
          creating a bundle using unnamed packages (like just an svn
          repository without ``#egg=Package``).
        
        0.1.4
        -----
        
        * Added an option ``--install-option`` to pass options to pass
          arguments to ``setup.py install``
        
        * ``.svn/`` directories are no longer included in bundles, as these
          directories are specific to a version of svn -- if you build a
          bundle on a system with svn 1.5, you can't use the checkout on a
          system with svn 1.4.  Instead a file ``svn-checkout.txt`` is
          included that notes the original location and revision, and the
          command you can use to turn it back into an svn checkout.  (Probably
          unpacking the bundle should, maybe optionally, recreate this
          information -- but that is not currently implemented, and it would
          require network access.)
        
        * Avoid ambiguities over project name case, where for instance
          MyPackage and mypackage would be considered different packages.
          This in particular caused problems on Macs, where ``MyPackage/`` and
          ``mypackage/`` are the same directory.
        
        * Added support for an environmental variable
          ``$PIP_DOWNLOAD_CACHE`` which will cache package downloads, so
          future installations won't require large downloads.  Network access
          is still required, but just some downloads will be avoided when
          using this.
        
        0.1.3
        -----
        
        * Always use ``svn checkout`` (not ``export``) so that
          ``tag_svn_revision`` settings give the revision of the package.
        
        * Don't update checkouts that came from ``.pybundle`` files.
        
        0.1.2
        -----
        
        * Improve error text when there are errors fetching HTML pages when
          seeking packages.
        
        * Improve bundles: include empty directories, make them work with
          editable packages.
        
        * If you use ``-E env`` and the environment ``env/`` doesn't exist, a
          new virtual environment will be created.
        
        * Fix ``dependency_links`` for finding packages.
        
        0.1.1
        -----
        
        * Fixed a NameError exception when running pip outside of a
          virtualenv environment.
        
        * Added HTTP proxy support (from Prabhu Ramachandran)
        
        * Fixed use of ``hashlib.md5`` on python2.5+ (also from Prabhu
          Ramachandran)
        
        0.1
        ---
